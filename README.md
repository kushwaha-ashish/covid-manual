## Staying safe from COVID: Some Dos and Donts

My mother and her brother, and my uncle, died from COVID in the last week. One of my friend is in the ICU and his blood oxygen is `84`! My father is now recovering from COVID. I have started this list based on what we did wrong and what we got right. Please read carefully. These instructions supplement the [CDC instructions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).  I know in my heart that "it is impossible for (people) to obey a bunch of rules unless they understand how (they work)", so **please read the explanations**. The latest version is maintained at https://github.com/pushpendre/covid-manual. Tell me if you see something wrong. `Please share if you think its useful`.

1. **Take steam regularly.**

The virus first infects the airways in our nose. After growing in the nose it travels to the lungs and other organs. High temperature can kill the virus and **slow down (not stop)** the growth of the virus. Think of it as disinfecting your nose.

2. **Vaccine means more than an injection.**

The vaccine injection needs many things to be successful. The vaccine must be stored at the right temperature. The synringe must be clean and the medical staff must be healthy. **YOU MUST MAINTAIN 6 FEET DISTANCE AT THE VACCINE SITE FROM OTHERS**. The vaccine only starts working two weeks after injection so you must wear mask and avoid meeting others till two weeks after your second dose. Unless all these rules are followed are done your vaccination will fail.

3. **Do not meet your relatives.**

Do not go to meet your relatives without PPE. Do not enter their home. Do not take off your mask in front of them. You do not want to infect your relatives. You will have your whole life to meet them after the infection is over. 

4. **If you have ever had diabetes or sugar problem or heart problem in your life monitor your blood sugar and BP.**

Treatment of COVID sometimes requires blood thinners and it can cause dehydration. Your blood sugar can spike uncontrollably suddenly if you get infected. Monitor your blood sugar everyday. 

5. **Any symptom is a COVID symptom**

The positivity rate for COVID is in high 20%. If you have black stool, loose motion, diarrhea, high fever, shortness of breath, any thing at all, it is highly probable that it is because of COVID. The RT-PCR test does not work if the infection has advanced too much. So negative RT-PCR can mean either that you do not have COVID, or that you have advanced COVID. Get a CT SCAN, or a CRP test, or other tests.
